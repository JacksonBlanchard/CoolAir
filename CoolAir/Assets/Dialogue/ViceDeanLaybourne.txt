Do you feel that? No, of course you don't, because this room is room temperature, THE room temperature. Your skin will seemingly disappear as it becomes one with air. It's truly a marvel of air conditioning technology.
Curse my old age! Even at room temperature I get tired just from walking around, not to mention this nagging pain in my chest. Or, perhaps there is too much freon in the coolant chamber... (goes to fiddle with air conditioner)
Of course it's just heartburn! How could I be so foolish to blame it on this perfect air. Here's some ammonia as thanks for the prescription. I'll never understand why the doctor likes his apartment so cold, but this should do the trick.
