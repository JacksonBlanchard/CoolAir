I don't know about you, but I haven't seen the doctor come out of his apartment lately. He's kind of a suspicious guy, I wouldn't be suprised if he is making illegal contraband in there.
Listen son, this isn't a charity, I am not just going to *give* you the pump for free. Tell you what I know someone on this floor has voodoo dolls. I heard they can be used to do some real damage to people without even being close to them. There is someone in my life who needs to be taught a lesson but I can't really get close to them. Get me that doll, I don't care how, and I'll give you the pump as payment.
Is that the doll!? You did good son. Now I can finally teach my cheating ex wife a lesson! Don't look at me like that, my personal life ain't none of your business. Here take the pump and get outta here, I have matters that I need to take care of.
