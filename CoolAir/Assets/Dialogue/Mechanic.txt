The whether sure is nice today, although I do smell something weird from the doctor's apartment down the hall. That chap is always upto something

Ahh, you want the wrench, everyone likes to do a little tinkerin' these days. Tell you what kid, I am starving, and I haven't eaten anything all day, I would love to have some soup right now. Get me some soup and the wrench is all yours. Is that a deal then? Well then chop chop.

Ohh myyyy goodness I smell something delicious! Is that some soup for me. You've done well kid, here ya go there's your wrench. I hope you know how to use it. What do you even need it fo.... ahh who cares, just be careful with it.

What now kid, I am exhausted, that soup really filled me up and I really want to take a nap? What? A pen? How do you not have a pen. Whatever, well let's make another deal, these papers need clipping, so fetch me some paper clips and I'll give you the pen.

*Yawns* what do you want, can't you see I was sleeping. Oh, the paper clips, thanks kid, you've been helpful today, maybe you can become my assistant. Anyway here ya go, now let me sleep in piece. And please, for the love of god, get yourself some pens.
