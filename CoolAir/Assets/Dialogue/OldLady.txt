Oh wait a minute. Here. I made some soup earlier and you look like you could use a good meal. What with you helping the Doctor in that arctic he calls an apartment. This should warm you right up!
Ah you caught me at a bad time. See I'm working on a bit of a hobby of mine but it seems I've run out of my thread. If you would be a dear and get me some more I'll make sure to give you a sample of my work.
You found some! Oh thank you. I don't know what I would have done if I wasn't able to finish in time. Here, I'll give you one for going out of your way for me.
